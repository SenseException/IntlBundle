## Installation

You can install it with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer require senseexception/intl-bundle
```

If the composer installation with symfony/flex didn't already register the bundle, you need to register it into your
bundles.php manually:

``` php
return [
    Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    Budgegeria\Bundle\IntlBundle\BudgegeriaIntlBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    // ...
];
```

## Configuration

By default a configuration doesn't need to be added if the needed locale is `en_US` and `USD` the currency. For any other
locale or currency you can add the following configuration to your project and configure the needed locale and currency
values:

``` yaml
budgegeria_intl:
  locale: 'de_DE'
  currency: 'EUR'
```

## Usage

#### Filters

Internationalization text formatting:
``` twig
{{ "This is the %ordinal time that the number %integer appear"|intl_format(4, 6000) }}
{# This is the 4th time that the number 6.000 appear #}
```

#### Functions

Internationalization text formatting:
``` twig
{{ intl_format("This is the %ordinal time that the number %integer appear", 4, 6000) }}
{# This is the 4th time that the number 6.000 appear #}
```
